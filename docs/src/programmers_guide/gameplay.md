## Gameplay

Zooshi puts the player on an endless river rafting ride to feed sushi to
some hungry, but well-dressed, jungle animals.

While cruising down the river, your goal is to hurl sushi into the mouths of
as many animal patrons as you can!

For each lap around the river, you will notice the minimum number of patrons
that must be feed will increase. Meet (or exceed) the quota for that lap and
the gate will open for another thrilling lap of sushi launching, at a more
extreme speed. However if you do not meet the quota, the gate will not open and
your game will come to an end.
